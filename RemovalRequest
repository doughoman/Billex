Please remove this repository from your account.

This is private code that is not meant to be open to the public and has either been mistakenly made public by a contract programmer
or has been made public intentionally for which I will have to follow whatever steps necessary to have the code taken down.
I would prefer not to have to do that.

You can contact me at doug@emri.net to reply to this message.

Thanks,
Doug
